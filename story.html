      <h3>How did this happen?</h3>
      <section class="story">
        <p>Ray and Melissa met when Melissa joined Appcues in March 2016, where Ray had been working for about a year. After months of sitting next to each other, an ice cream sandwich challenge, and many questions about CSS selectors, they had become good friends.</p>

      <p>Melissa introduced Ray to the best ice cream in the world. Ray introduced Melissa to skee-ball.</p>
      <p>Despite enjoying each others company, they kept it mostly professional.</p>

        <p>Melissa left the team in 2017, but they still kept in touch. Without work in common they got to focus on the important things, like eating donuts and going on hikes.</p>
        <p>Eventually Melissa realized, "it was him the whole time!" Luckily, the feeling was mutual. Ray had been patiently waiting for her to get on the same page.</p>
        <p>Without feelings stated out loud, they proceeded cautiously to protect their friendship. They went on a few “is this a date?” dates before Ray walked Melissa home in a blizzard and laid it all out there.</p>

      <p>From that day on, the two were in it for the long haul. Ray and Melissa couldn’t stop talking about the future they were so excited to share together.</p>
      <p>On a chilly fall day in November, just eight months after Ray’s blizzard confession, they got engaged in Ohio.<p>
      <p>Now the two live together in South Boston where they look forward to celebrating their wedding with their wonderful families and friends.<p>
